**Already the third day !!**
On today's menu, you will dive into the wonderful world of torch, by starting of use it and create advanced neural network after !

It's up to you to choose the order of the 2 last notebook, start by `my_torch` before do the `cifar` is a good things also !

> Here's a list of resources that we believe can be useful to follow along (and that we've ourselves used to learn these topics before being able to write the subjects):
